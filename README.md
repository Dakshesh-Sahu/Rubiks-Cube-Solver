# ðŸ§Š Rubik's Cube Solver

This project is a real-time Rubikâ€™s Cube solver that scans cube faces using a webcam, classifies colors with a trained ML model, and solves the cube using the Kociemba algorithmâ€”all via an interactive GUI. It simplifies the solving process, typically completing the cube in ~20 optimal moves.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. Color Model Training: Six .xlsx files contain RGB values for each cube face color. These are used to train a logistic regression model.

2. Face Scanning: The webcam captures cube faces and detects the 3Ã—3 grid layout via contour analysis.

3. Color Classification: Each grid cellâ€™s RGB average is predicted as a color label using the trained ML model.

4. Cube Solving: Once all six faces are scanned, a cube state string is passed to the Kociemba solver for an optimal solution.

5. Step-by-Step GUI Display: The GUI visually displays each move with directional arrows, guiding the user to solve the cube interactively.
